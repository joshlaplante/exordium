### Exordium - A Text-based Adventure Game
***
This is my first attempt at designing and developing an interactive game. Coded in Python 3, Exordium features classic RPG elements such as a  turn-based battle system and player choices that allow for various playstyles and unique storylines. Although fully functional at the moment, the game's playable length is only about 10% of what I envision. I will continue to update this repository as I find the time to develop the game further.
